# Jarvis
An AI Personal Assistant using Python!

If you are lazy like me and want your computer to do your basic tasks by you saying, Jarvis got you covered.
Be it doing a wikipedia search or a opening a particular application on your desktop or even sending a whatsapp
message, this Python based AI can do it all!

I have added basic stuff like opening google, wikipedia, youtube and other websites, opening camera, accessing
applications sending whatsapp messages and emails to anyone you like. Feel free to fork it and add any more
functionalities you would want your Jarvis to do!

*To send emails please make sure you have allowed access to less secure apps on gmail else the email won't be sent*

Pyaudio will not get installed by using the command *pip install pyaudio*. To install pyaudio on latest
Python versions especially after Python 3.7. Search "unofficial python binaries" on google and click on 
pyaudio from the list of modules available to be installed and then select your version of Python installed
in your system. This will install all the dependencies needed to install pyaudio. After downloading this
from the unofficial python libraries website progress with pip install on your command prompt as earlier!!

Have fun asking your personal assistant to do things for you!
